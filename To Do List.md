# Fix immediatley 





- # Short term
- **!m commands dont count towards rank or whitelist status**
- **Need system to hold inputs; up1s, up500ms, up1.5s - currently using combination of both to allow certain buttons to be held**
- **If !m m is out of bounds the following click will still parse e.g "!m m 50 50, lc" will return out of bounds message but still click**


# Long term
 - **is there a way to remove the need for m and p commands? e.g  "200 200,lc"**
 - **Handle all kb inputs through !m**
 - **Create macro system within !m**
 - **Start thinking about Twitch Plays Rimworld**
