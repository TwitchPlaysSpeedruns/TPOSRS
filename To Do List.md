# Fix immediatley 
- nothing for now




- # Short term
- **!m commands dont count towards rank or whitelist status** - TPS
- **Move channel to dedicated host and restart TPS main channel - sorry TPS2 =(**  - TPS
- **Overhaul overlay - add multiple styles-  add ways for chat to change overlay - community channel point goal?**  - TPS
- **Need system to hold inputs; up1s, up500ms, up1.5s - Also needs to have a cap. Ideally this could be variable per input e.g Up is capped at 2s, Space is capped at 10s.** - Cpt Chucklefuck
- **Can we set aliases like #inv1 for strings like "!m m 345 264, lc"?** - Cpt Chucklefuck

# Long term
 - **is there a way to remove the need for m and p commands? e.g  "200 200,lc"** maybe something like - if input is "300 200" or "3digits space 3digits" parse it as a m command, if input is = to "allowed key list" parse it as a p command??
 - **Handle all kb inputs through !m**
 - **Create macro system within !m**

# Potential ideas
- increase value for subscribers - current benefits: Onscreen emotes, Access to sub memes, Increased channel points, Sound effects,
- subs can change overlay?
